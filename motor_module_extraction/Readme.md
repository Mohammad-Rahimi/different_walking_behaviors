for extracting motor modules from the solution of choice you have to run : muscleSynsFromSimulation.m  
in the first line you determine the name of the solution you want to extract motor modules from  
the code extract 1 to 10 motor modules and show you how many is needed to explain variability in data with more than 95% VAF
