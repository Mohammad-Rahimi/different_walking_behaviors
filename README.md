in this project, different walking behaviors were simulated using direct collocation for trajectory optimization by Opensim Moco. once patterns of muscle activation were calculated for all 27 different walking behaviors including all possible combination of 3 different speeds, 3 different step length asymmetry level and 3 different step width, we implemented motor module extraction using 
NNMF algorithm to compare it with experimental results of similar trend of walking behavior through which we gain more understanding of interaction between nervous system and biomechanics of walking. finally patterns of muscle activation were reconstructed using non-linear programming approaches to evaluate the ability of one walking behavior motor modules to generate different 
gait behaviors
