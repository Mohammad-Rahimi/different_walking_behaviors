the code is uploaded with the needed intial guess and tracking references to run a simulation
open the code named: walk_speed_stepLengthAsym_stepwidth.m
first few lines you will determine the name of the initial guess, tracking file and solution file
the next section named option and settings is for assiginig different values for the average speed, step length asymmetry and step width and needed cost term weights
